To run interactively, use Jupyter Notebook with Python2.7 (this is what I used). Python3.x could also be used but I cannot guarantee everything will work, simply because I have not tested the example using that Python version.

You'll need to create a separate config file called oanda.cfg containing your account_id and access_token (obtainable from Oanda after registering).
